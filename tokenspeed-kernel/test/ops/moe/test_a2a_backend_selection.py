"""CPU-only unit tests for MORI all-to-all backend acceptance in the kernel layer.

Covers ``_validate_a2a_backend`` gating (``moe/__init__.py``). The
``a2a_backend='mori' -> solution='mori'`` mapping in ``moe_plan`` requires full
kernel selection (gfx950) and is exercised by the distributed gfx950 test instead.
