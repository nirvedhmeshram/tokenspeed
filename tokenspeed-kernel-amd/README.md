# TokenSpeed-Kernel-AMD

TokenSpeed-Kernel-AMD is a standalone collection of performance-oriented AMD GPU kernels for LLM inference. Its performance kernels are written in [Gluon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqeI23SpJx8). The package currently covers architecture-specific implementations for:

- Attention: MHA, MLA, DSA, and KDA
- MoE: BF16, MXFP4 weights
- GEMM

## Performance Numbers

The following measurements use GPT-OSS 120B workloads on one AMD Instinct MI355X GPU. They were collected at TokenSpeed commit [`1492030`](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/commit/1492030a2a02d32bc7011645a74d2d691e99c2e6), with AITER 0.1.13 and ROCm 7.2.1. See the [TokenSpeed-Kernel PyTorch blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/lightseek-tokenspeed-kernel/) for the complete methodology and analysis.

### Attention

The benchmark uses BF16 Q/K/V, head dimension 64, 64 query heads, 8 KV heads, full causal attention, and attention sinks. It covers sequence lengths 1K, 4K, and 8K with batch sizes from 1 to 16. Bars report throughput in TFLOP/s; higher is better. The Gluon kernel is the fastest evaluated backend. It is 1.4-2.3x faster than the Triton baseline and 1.1-1.3x faster than AITER.

### MoE

This benchmark measures full-MoE latency, including routing, both GEMMs, clamped SwiGLU, and combine, for GPT-OSS 120B with 128 experts, top-4 routing, MXFP4 weights, FP8 activations, and `D = I = 2880`. For small decode batches (`M = 1-4`), Gluon is 1.7-2.1x faster than Triton and 1.1-1.6x faster than AITER. At `M = 8-16`, Gluon remains 1.3-1.4x faster than Triton. The prefill results show Gluon substantially ahead of Triton and competitive with AITER across `M = 512-8192`.

## Package Organization

Kernels are organized by AMD architecture and operator family. This keeps architecture-specific tuning local while giving each family a consistent place for its implementations and supporting utilities.

Public entry points currently remain architecture-specific. Consumers should import the implementation matching the target GPU, or use TokenSpeed-Kernel to select a compatible implementation through its registry.

## Usage

Install a ROCm-compatible PyTorch build first, then install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tokenspeed-kernel-amd
```

For development from this repository:

```bash
pip install -e ./tokenspeed-kernel-amd
```
